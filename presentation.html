                    Databinding in the modern Javascript world is virtually uniform in terms of features,
                    the differences between various frameworks comes down to syntax and the mechanism used under the covers.

                        What you need to do MVVM in a nutshell:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A bespoke model for each view, with 2-way databinding being the sole link between the "view" and the "view-model".
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        This was primarily devised by Microsoft to fix inherent problems in how their desktop apps were designed and built,
                        but it can be used for web apps as well.

                    <li>
                        Angular officially supports MVW.

                    <!--<li>DOM manipulation is kept out of the view.</li>
                    <br>-->
                    <li>Angular does not use change listeners or "observable properties" like Silverlight or Knockout in an effort to avoid the overhead those techniques bring with them.</li>

                <hr>
                <blockquote>
                    To contrast dirty-checking (AngularJS) vs change listeners (KnockoutJS and Backbone.js):
                    While dirty-checking may seem simple, and even inefficient (I will address that later), it turns out that it is semantically correct all the time,
                    while change listeners have lots of weird corner cases [e.g. change coalescence and change listener synchonization] and need things like dependency tracking to make it more semantically correct.
                    KnockoutJS dependency tracking is a clever feature for a problem which AngularJS does not have.

                        So this dirty checking technique seems like it'd be slow, right?

                        In reality, it's really fast. Turns out most browsers from IE8 on up are really good at executing Javascript quickly.
